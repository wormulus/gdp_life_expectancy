GDP and Life Expectancy Data Visualization

Graphs using seaborn and matplotlib (plus pandas and numpy) to analyze GDP and Life Expectancy data of five different countries from 2000-2015


Questions that came up while analyzing data -- 
- Why do Chile and Zimbabwe have lower GDPs but largely dissimilar life expectancies?
- Why is Mexico's GDP higher than Chile's but life expectancy lower?
- What happened in Zimbabwe in the early 2000s to make such a large change in life expectancy?
- Why is GDP in USA so high, but life expectancy is lower than Germany?
- Why is China's GDP rising at a much higher rate than the others?
